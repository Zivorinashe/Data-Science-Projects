# Zivo's Data Science Projects

This Github Repository contains projects that I have created as part of my Data Science training. My Data Science Projects include, but are not limited to:

* Creating A Chatbot
  * In this project, I developed a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot interacts with users to provide information, answer questions, 
    or assist with specific tasks.
* Web Scrapping
  * Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. The project specifically targets Indian billionaires' data from Wikipedia. In this project, I used techniques     such as parsing HTML, navigating web pages, and extracting relevant information. Web scraping is valuable for collecting data from online sources for analysis. 
* Simple Data Analytics
  * In this set of projects, I conducted data analytics tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Using popular Python libraries like Pandas and 
    Matplotlib, I analyzed datasets to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.
* Flight Price Prediction 
  * This project predicts flight prices using machine learning and offers interactive visualizations for data exploration. By analyzing historical flight data, it provides 
    insights into pricing trends and helps users make informed travel decisions.
