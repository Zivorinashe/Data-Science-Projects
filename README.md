# Zivo's Data Science Projects

This Github Repository contains projects that I have created as part of my Data Science training. My Data Science Projects inclde, but are not limited to:

* Creating A Chatbot
  * This project focuses on developing a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot interacts with users to provide information, answer questions, 
    or assist with specific tasks.
* Web Scrapping
  * Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. The project specifically targets Indian billionaires' data from Wikipedia. This involve techniques 
    such as parsing HTML, navigating web pages, and extracting relevant information. Web scraping is valuable for collecting data from online sources for analysis. 
* Simple Data Analytics
  * This project involves conducting basic data analytics tasks such as data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Using popular Python libraries like Pandas and 
    Matplotlib, I analyze datasets to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.
